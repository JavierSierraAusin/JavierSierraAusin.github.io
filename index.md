My name is Javier Sierra-Ausin.  I am research scientist in fluid dynamics.  <br />
My research focuses on fundamental aspects of **hydrodynamic instabilities** and **nonlinear dynamics** applied to multi-physics and multiscale problems, which are mostly studied by means of computational and theoretical approaches.  <br />
Why *multi-physics*?  <br /> 

I study problems in fluid mechanics with a fluid (incompressible or compressible) interacting with a solid body (rigid or deformable), or with a second phase, which is not necessarily another classical fluid, it may be for instance, a plasma (so far only a cold-plasma). <br />
Why *multiscale*?  <br /> 

My collaborators and I, we study problems involving many distinct physical scales, and we employ either fine mesh adaptation techniques to efficiently characterise the physics, or asymptotic models to characterise the small scales.  <br /><br />
*Some more info about me*: <br /> I am currently a  post-doc scientist involved in the <a href="https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-20-ASTC-0029/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">ANR project PROPULS-ION</font></a> under the supervision of <a href="https://franckplouraboue.net/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Franck Plorabué</font></a>. <br />
Before that, I did my PhD (cotutelle-thesis) at the <a href="https://www.imft.fr/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">IMFT</font></a> and <a href="https:/unisa.it" target="_blank"> <font color="brown"> UNISA</font> </a>, under supervision of <a href="https://www.imft.fr/pages-personnelles/fabre-david/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">David Fabre</font></a>, and <a href="https://docenti.unisa.it/020052/home" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Flavio Giannetti</font></a>.
In my dissertation -- titled [<i>Mode interactions in external flows</i>](https://www.theses.fr/s295292){:target="blank"} -- One of the aims is the determination of the *universal* features in the *laminar-chaotic* transition by means of *bifurcation theory*. What do I mean by *universal* features in the *laminar-chaotic* transition ? It denotes the spatio-temporal symmetry-breaking path followed by the system in the parametric space towards chaotic dynamics. In particular, here I focus on the existence of *organising centres* of the parametric space, i.e., bifurcations of codimension equal to the number of parametres of the problem, which serve to classify the dynamics near the onset of instability.  We analyse these features in several configurations, incompressible flows, mixed-convection, compressible flows, fluid-structure interaction and flows with bubbles. 
<br /><br />
Already quite a while ago, I started my journey in academia studying aerospace engineering and mathematics.
